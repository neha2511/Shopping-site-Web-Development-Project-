Web Development Project

This is the final project repo of CS546 for our group.

_YOU MUST TRACK ALL DOCUMENTS AND CODE IN THIS REPO!_ 





To: [![Heroku](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=cs546&style=flat)](https://cs546.herokuapp.com/)

## Outline

We decide to build a website for people to sell their used stuff.

### Technical detail: 

We will use HTML, CSS to create and style website pages.
We will use MongoDB to store all data in our website, like user account, post item.
We will use AJAX for error checking, like checking if user fills out all required information, and if their inputs are valid.
Given that each Stevens student have an unique email address, we will implement email address verification by sending link to their email, to avoid mistakes link will only be valid when the browser requesting the verification access it.

### Non-technical detail:

After accomplishing this project, we expect people to post the information of about the stuff they would like to sell. Also every user will have a portal of his own. Thus on login every user can be notified about the items in sale that match his interest as specified in the user account information. Also every user would be given the liberty to perform advanced searches based on his/her interests, budget and requirement about the items the user wishes to buy. The payment and transaction can be done online directly using the account info of the buyer and the account info provided by the seller.

## Code Example //TBD

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation //TBD

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

```
npm install
npm test
npm start
```

## API Reference //TBD

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests //TBD

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.


## License //TBD

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
